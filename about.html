    <font color=white><p>We are an open source community initiated by MCA students of NIT Trichy.
       We learn, work and share the joys of Open source technologies and wish 
       to contribute to the Open Source Society. We also provide an encouraging
       environment for development and research on Open source software through 
       collaboration with the open source community, business establishments,
       and other organizations. The community is expected to be a portal for 
       knowledge & education and to forge relationships with the open source world.</p></font>
